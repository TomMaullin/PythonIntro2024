You can think of a *reference* as an address which tells us where some data lives physically on a machine. When we talk about variables, we really are talking about *reference*'s (which we have named) that point us to some data in memory.\n",

    "What is important to know here is that when you change the value of a variable which has an \"immutable\" data type you are changing a *reference* whereas when you are changing \"mutable\" variables you are changing the data itself. Examples of mutable data types in Python include the `list`, `dictionary` and the `set`. On the other hand, examples of immutable data types are given by the `int`, `float`, `decimal`, `bool` and the `tuple`. In general, the more complicated data types discussed so far are \"mutable\". \n",
